ALTER TABLE restaurant_business_accounts 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS trial_started_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS trial_expires_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT (NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days'),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_customer_id TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS opening_hours TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS special_notes TEXT;
