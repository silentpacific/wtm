Subject: WhatTheMenu - AI menu translator for your next launch?

Hi [Hunter Name],

I've been following your launches and loved how you presented [specific launch they did]. 

I've built WhatTheMenu - an AI-powered app that instantly translates restaurant menus and explains dishes in 80+ languages. Perfect for travelers who've stared at a menu wondering "what is that?"

The tech is interesting: we use Gemini AI with fuzzy matching across multiple languages and have a sophisticated caching system.

Would you be interested in hunting this? Happy to provide a demo and early access.

Best,
[Your name]
P.S. - I noticed you travel frequently based on your posts - this might actually be useful for you!
```
