        <FaqSection title="Getting Started" emoji="üöÄ">
            <FaqQuestion question="How does it work?">
                <p>Super simple! Just upload a photo of any menu (or snap one with your camera), and our AI will analyze it and explain what each dish actually is. No more playing menu roulette!</p>
            </FaqQuestion>

            <FaqQuestion question="What file formats do you accept?">
                <p>We accept JPG, JPEG, PNG, and WEBP files. Sorry, but we can't read QR codes yet - you'll need an actual image of the menu.</p>
            </FaqQuestion>

            <FaqQuestion question="Is there a file size limit?">
                <p>Yep, keep it under 10 MB. Most phone photos are way smaller than this, so you should be fine.</p>
            </FaqQuestion>

            <FaqQuestion question="How long does processing take?">
                <p>Pretty fast! Menu scanning takes 2-3 seconds, and each dish explanation takes 1-3 seconds. If lots of hungry people are using the app at once, it might take a bit longer.</p>
            </FaqQuestion>
        </FaqSection>

        <FaqSection title="Using the App" emoji="üì±">
            <FaqQuestion question="What happens if my menu has multiple pages?">
                <p>Each page counts as one scan. You could try fitting two pages in one photo, but we recommend one page at a time for the best results.</p>
            </FaqQuestion>

            <FaqQuestion question="Can I scan multiple menus at once?">
                <p>Nope, one menu at a time. But hey, that keeps things simple!</p>
            </FaqQuestion>

            <FaqQuestion question="Does the app work offline?">
                <p>You'll need an internet connection since our AI lives in the cloud.</p>
            </FaqQuestion>

            <FaqQuestion question="Are my menu scans saved?">
                <p>You can see your dish explanations as long as you keep the browser tab open. Close the tab? You'll need to scan again. We don't save your scans for privacy reasons.</p>
            </FaqQuestion>

            <FaqQuestion question="Can I save or share the menu explanations?">
                <p>Not right now - each person gets their own explanations. If you're eating with friends, just pass the phone around or read the good stuff out loud! üòä</p>
            </FaqQuestion>
        </FaqSection>

        <FaqSection title="Languages & Accuracy" emoji="üåç">
            <FaqQuestion question="What languages does the app support?">
                <p>Our AI can read menus in pretty much any major language - it's been trained on tons of different cuisines and writing systems.</p>
                <p>The explanations come in 4 languages: English, Spanish, Chinese (‰∏≠Êñá), and French. We're adding more languages gradually!</p>
            </FaqQuestion>

            <FaqQuestion question="Is the information always accurate?">
                <p>Our AI is usually spot-on, but it's not perfect. The explanations are for guidance only. <strong>Always double-check with restaurant staff about allergens or specific dietary needs</strong> - especially if you have celiac disease or serious allergies.</p>
            </FaqQuestion>
        </FaqSection>

        <FaqSection title="Food & Menu Types" emoji="üçΩÔ∏è">
            <FaqQuestion question="Does this work for drink/cocktail menus or just food?">
                <p>It works for everything you'd typically find on a menu - food, drinks, cocktails, desserts, specialty items, the works!</p>
            </FaqQuestion>

            <FaqQuestion question="Can it identify allergens and dietary restrictions?">
                <p>Yes! The system mentions common allergens in dishes, but <strong>please always confirm with your waiter before ordering</strong>. AI tools are generic and might miss something specific to your needs.</p>
                <p>We're thinking about adding a feature where you can specify your dietary restrictions. Stay tuned!</p>
            </FaqQuestion>

            <FaqQuestion question="Can it help with wine lists and beverage pairings?">
                <p>Great idea! We're planning to add wine pairing suggestions in the future. Imagine scanning a wine list and getting perfect pairing recommendations - pretty cool, right?</p>
            </FaqQuestion>

            <FaqQuestion question="Does it work with dessert menus or specialty cuisine menus?">
                <p>Absolutely! Whether it's molecular gastronomy, traditional regional dishes, or fancy desserts, our AI has seen it all.</p>

            <FaqQuestion question="Why do you charge when some translation apps are free?">
                <p>Fair question! We're not just translating text - we're analyzing entire menus, identifying dishes, explaining ingredients, flagging allergens, and providing cultural context. That takes some serious AI power (and server costs)!</p>
            </FaqQuestion>

            <FaqQuestion question="Is an account required for paid passes?">
                <p>Yes, you'll need to create an account. This helps us track your purchase, investigate any technical issues, and process refunds if needed.</p>
            </FaqQuestion>

            <FaqQuestion question="Are upgrades allowed?">
                <p>Totally! You can upgrade from free to paid, or from daily to weekly. Just heads up: if you upgrade from daily to weekly after using some of your daily hours, you don't get those hours back. Our system isn't set up for partial refunds.</p>
            </FaqQuestion>

            <FaqQuestion question="Do you offer subscriptions?">
                <p>Not yet, but we're thinking about it! Some frequent travelers have asked for monthly or yearly options. We'll probably add those in the future.</p>
